title: About Me
subtitle: I'm a junior Computer Science major studying at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. My passion is computer security, or more specifically, digital forensics. I grew up in The Poconos, Pennsylvania, and recently moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania permanently for school. During my free time, I enjoy at-home-projects and research in order to gain a deeper understanding of all things technology related.
